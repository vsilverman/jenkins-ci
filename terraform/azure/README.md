# Deployment to Azure cloud with Terraform

## Quick start

**Note**: These folder shows how to deploy a multi-tier web app into your Azure account.
You may consider using [Azure Free Tier](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/),
and still occasionally check your billing console to avoid being
accidentally charged for using those services.

Deploying a multi-tier web application to Azure with Terraform involves several steps. Here's a high-level overview of the process:

1. Set up an Azure account and create a service principal
To use Terraform with Azure, you need to have an Azure account and create a service principal. The service principal is an identity that Terraform will use to authenticate with Azure and provision resources on your behalf.

2. Define the infrastructure in Terraform
In this step, you define the Azure resources that your application will require in a Terraform file. This can include resource groups, virtual networks, subnets, security groups, storage containers, and other resources that are required to support your application.

3. Define the application architecture
Once you have defined the infrastructure, you need to define the architecture of your web application. This includes defining the different tiers of your application (e.g., web server, middleware logic, database server) and their associated resources.

4. Write Terraform code
With the infrastructure and application architecture defined, you can write the Terraform code that will provision and configure the resources. This involves creating Terraform modules for each tier of your application and using them to create the necessary resources.

5. Test and deploy
After writing the Terraform code, you need to test it to ensure that everything is working as expected. Once you are satisfied with the code, you can deploy it to Azure using the terraform apply command.

6. After you are done clean up and destroy all created resources to avoid unnesseasry charges.

Overall, deploying a multi-tier web application to Azure with Terraform requires a significant amount of planning and configuration. However, by using Terraform, you can ensure that your infrastructure and application architecture are consistent and reproducible across multiple environments.
